# Assembly-Based 2 Player Tic-Tac-Toe
The goal of this project was to create a working 2 player Tic-Tac-Toe board. It kept track of what moves had been played, and checked after every turn whether someone had won. Enticing start animations and a celebratory win state were added at the end. [game.asm](game/game.asm) contains all the code that ran on the microcontroller during a game. I also hacked together an 'Animation Creator' in Javascript to help me create animations.
